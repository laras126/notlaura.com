			<h1>Portfolio</h1>
			<p class="header-lead">Case studies from projects I've completed as an independent consultant.</p>
			<p>My independent client work primarily consists of custom WordPress theme builds and front-end UI development for startups. I have both worked as a front-end development contractor within teams as well as a one-woman agency, designing, developing, and launching websites for a variety of businesses.</p>
			<p>Working independently has allowed me the ability to pursue my teaching career as well, notably the development of a set of online courses and a tutoring business I called the Tackle Box.</p>
