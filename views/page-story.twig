				<h2 class="panel-title">Greetings, fellow tech person!</h2>
				<p class="lead">I focus on three things: CSS, WordPress, and exploring the role of programming fundamentals in front-end development.</p>
				<p>By weekday, I work as a <strong>Design Engineer</strong> at Penske Media Corporation, building out a design system for big WordPress VIP websites like the Rolling Stone and Variety.</p>
				<p>By weekend, and the occasional early morning, I write about my design systems work on my blog, and I explore the parallels between CSS and programming concepts by way of my ongoing talk, <a href="/algorithms-of-css-sources/">The Algorithms of CSS</a>.</p>

				<p class="panel-indicator">Non-Techie</p>
				<h2 class="panel-title">I build websites!</h2>
				<p class="lead">More specifically, the "front-end" of websites.</p>
				<p>The front end of a website is <em>what you see</em> on a web page, rather than the behind-the-scenes code that powers the functionality and data (a.k.a. the back-end), although I do a bit of that side, too.</p>
				<p>My official job is a <strong>Design Engineer</strong> at Penske Media Corporation, the umbrella company for big brands like the Rolling Stone and Variety. As a Design Engineer, I work at the intersection of design and development, creating tools and processes to help each side better communicate with the other.</p>
